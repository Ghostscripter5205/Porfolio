      <p>
        I'm a passionate and self-driven developer with a wide range of skills in full-stack web development, Discord bot creation, and Roblox game systems. As the founder of <strong>Ghost Studios</strong>, I lead multiple game, utility, and system development projects with a focus on quality, automation, and user experience. Under my sub-brand, <strong>Axis Development</strong>, I specialize in ERLC-related tools and frameworks such as CAD/MDT systems, bot-to-server integrations, and interactive dashboards. I love building scalable backend systems, intuitive frontends, and Discord bots that actually make communities run smoother. Whether itâ€™s a custom moderation panel, an in-game data system, or a business-level API, I take pride in shipping useful, clean solutions that work.
